# Course Content: Software Design and Architecture
This repository is an initiative for developing course content for the Software Design and Architecture course of IUT CSE. The goal is to make sure that relevant and suitable topics with useful content are covered in the course. To make the initiative a success, the software practitioners as well as experienced educators are invited to contribute to it. 

Note that the [license of the repository](LICENSE) is very open (MIT) so that anyone can make use of it.
