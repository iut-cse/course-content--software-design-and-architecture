# Course Content: Software Design and Architecture
This repository is an initiative for developing course content for the Software Design and Architecture course of IUT CSE. The goal of this initiative is to make sure that the correct and important topics are covered in the course with useful content. To make the initiative successful, the software practitioners as well as experienced educators are invited to contribute to it. Please read the [contributors' guidline](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how you can contribute.
